        "**str:** Stands for \"string\". Represents sequences of characters.\n",
        "Use Case: Names, titles, messages, and virtually any kind of text in a program.\n",
        "\n",
        "**bool:** Represents a Boolean value, which can be either True or False.\n",
        "Use Case: Flags, conditions, or any binary decisions (yes/no, on/off).\n",
        "\n",
        "**float:** Represents real numbers (i.e., numbers with decimals).\n",
